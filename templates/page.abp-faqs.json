With the bid timeline set to be finalised in mid July, it will be a logistical challenge to execute an event on such short notice.

Usually bids have a full year to prepare for the event after winning the bid, so event 3-4 months is considered pretty tight.<\/p><p>That considered, an event with sufficient preparation will put us in the November\/December period if we wanted to host it this year. <\/p><p>The November\/December period is not an ideal time to host the event as flight prices are usually the highest in that period. In addition, university exams taking place towards the end of November or early December makes it all the more challenging for teams to attend.<\/p><p>Having Asian BP this year will also have it wedged between two world championships. The delayed Belgrade Worlds (Online) will take place in July while Madrid Worlds (In-Person) will take place in December.
