Being a self-taught debater made her develop unique tricks and methods to win debates that she still relies on to this day! Leah's favorite speaker position is first-response, and she is known for being able to come up with rebuttals to almost any argument on the spot. Leah is currently doing a Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Economics and Marketing Management at Macquarie University.  Leah believes that coaching debate is not just teaching students the right arguments or the correct methods for a topic. It is equally important to inspire and motivate debaters to interrogate the ideas they come across daily, so they may develop the ability to come up with creative and original arguments in debates. Leah believes that the participants must learn the building blocks of becoming an excellent debater by applying them in practice-based activities of varying lengths and styles. They should do more than simply practice debates - by focussing on more specific exercises that develop a targeted skill, and focus on feedback received for their improvement. <strong><br\/><\/strong><\/p>","link_label":"","link":""}},"1654756856f4d2000f-1":{"type":"column","settings":{"title":"","text":"<p><strong>DEBATE EXPERIENCE: <\/strong><\/p><p><strong><br\/><\/strong>Australs Grand Finalist, 2021<\/p><p>Worlds Octo Finalist, 2021<\/p><p>Easters Best Speaker, 2022<\/p><p><strong><br\/><\/strong><\/p>","link_label":"","link":""}},"1654756856f4d2000f-2":{"type":"column","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"Column","text":"<p>Pair text with an image to focus on your chosen product, collection, or blog post.
